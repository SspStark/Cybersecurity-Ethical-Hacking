# Cybersecurity

 **Cyber** --> Interconnected Things, Devices that connnected to internet or Digital world.
 
**Cybersecurity** --> Protecting Data, Network, Applications, Systems everything that connceted to Internet.</br>
**The Practice of defending cyberspace from cyber attacks**.

**Cybersecurity** Aspects are like Information Security, Webapplication Security, Mobileapplication Security etc.

### CVE --> Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
**CVE** is a list of records, each containing an identification number, and details for publicly known vulnerabilities.

For CVE there is a scoring system called **[CVSS](https://www.cvedetails.com/)** (common vulnerability scoring system).

In Cybersecurity there is term called **CIA Traid**, it represents **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, **Availability**.

# Ethical Hacking

**Hacking** --> Simply Expading Internet Boundries, Functionalities or Attacking the systems or devices that are connected to internet.\
**Ethical Hacking** --> Doing hacking for good purposes.\
**Criminal Hacking or Cracking** --> Doing hacking for bad purposes.

**Hacker** --> One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of ***creative problem solving*** or ***overcoming limitations***.

### Phishing
In Digital world Phishing means Art of Tricking People which is a technique used by hackers.\
Most of the Phishing happen via sending Fake Emails and also Fake Messages to install Malware(malicious software) in our device to steal our information.

#### Ransomeware
Phishing leads to Ransomeware which is commonly called as Digital Kidnapping.\
Ransomeware happens when we clicked on a unknown link which install malware in our device.\
Once the malware is installed the ***Attacker*** can lock our device and we cannot access it, the attacker will have complete control over our data and will blackmail us to pay money in exchange of our data.

## Frameworks to work with Cybersecurity

### STRIDE
- Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privlege

**STRIDE** framework was developed by Microsoft, It helps to understand different kinds of cyber threats and how to counter them.

**Spoofing** --> Impersonating something or someone else, more like a using fake ID's to trick people.

**Tampering** --> Modifying someone data or information without authorization.

**Repudiation** --> Denying the wrongdoings or an action that are done by you.

**Info Disclosure** --> Exposing information to someone who are not authorized to see it.

**Denial of Service** --> Denying the access to authorized users, where we can"t access our information.

**Elevation of Privlege** --> Gaining knowledge about something or someone without having authorization/permission.

## Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Approaches and Methodoligies
### Ethical Hacking Strategies & Others
- **Vulnerability Scanning** --> Automated(tool-based) scanning assets (IPs or applications) to identify low hanging known vulnerabilities in a system or application.
- **Vulnerability Assessment** --> Automated & Manual assessment of assets in scope to find security vulnerabilities more over to understand which are weak,moderated,high risk vulnerabilities.
- **Penetrating Testing** --> Exploiting vulnerabilities under controlled circumstances; in a professional, safe manager according to the rules of engagement, simply to check that system can be hacked using the all the possible vulnerabilities.
- **Red Teaming** --> It is used to check the effectiveness of blue team's detection and response, act and use tactics & techniques like real hackers.
- **Bug Bounties** --> Legally finding ***bugs***/***vulnerabilities***. 
### 1.Penetration Testing
- Step 1: **Gathering Intelligence** about the target.
- step 2: **Vulnerability Assessment** --> selecting ways that can be easily accessed.
- step 3: **Exploitation** --> Taking advantage of entering into someone's device or system.
- step 4: **Post Exploitation** --> Creating backdoors to enter or access the target whenever they want.
- step 5: **Leaving no Traces** --> Clearing all the proofs like you were never there to not to get caught.

### 2.Cyber Kill Chain
### 3.MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- **ATT&CK** --> Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge. 
- It is a huge Knowledge base of **hacking techniques** based on real-world cyberattacks.
- It is an attack oriented approach, where we have to think and work like an attacker to stop the attacker.
### 4.NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **NIST** --> National Institute of Standards and Technology.
- It is an US government agency, it is a defence oriented approach.
### Threat Modelling
- Analyzing and identifying attacks(threats) **before** then happen.
- Analysing the blueprint of a system.
- **STRIDE** is a Threat Modelling Framework.
#### Basic Technical Skills & Tools of Ethical Hacker
- Knowledge of programming
- Understanding of databases
- Knowledge of search engines and servers
- Scripting Knowledge
- Knowledge of hacking tools
- Knowledge of multiple OS
- Networking skills
